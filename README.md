## What will your app do?
Our app will help clients find the right healthcare provider. It will allow users to select their location, insurance, doctor specialty, and the doctor's gender in order to match them up with the most optimal healthcare provider and doctor for their specific treatment needs.
## Who would use your app?
Anyone looking to find a doctor that accepts specific insurance networks.  This includes users with insurance and those looking to see if an insurance network offers sufficient coverage in their area.  
## What are its main features?
Our app will include a main form that allows users to input data into various fields (location, insurance, doctor specialty, doctor gender). Once submitted, our app will show a list of doctors that match the criteria. Along with the doctor’s name, we will also show each doctor’s contact information, rating, address and other relevant data for the user. With firebase, users are able to sign up for an account and once signed in, will be able to save the doctors they have previously searched in a ‘Saved Doctors’ list.
